		<h1>You've arrived at Cape Cod!</h1>
	<p>It is time to realx. You've spent so much time in your car and walking around that now it's time to just sit and take in the air around you. You find the nearest beach and set up your space there. You take out the blanket you had packed for the cold new england air and place it onto the sand and sit and take in the sun. You forgot how good it felt to do nothing. When you have free time in NYC you mostly spend it being mad at the city around you, instead of enjoying life's little things. Thank you to Cape Cod for helping me realize that. </p>

	<h4>The beach was so great. I am so glad im experiencing the different parts of the east coast? Where to now? </h4>
