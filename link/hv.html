	<h1>You've arrived in the Hudson Valley!</h1>
	<p>You get to the Hudson Valley and you're amazed at hoe beautiful the drive up was and how cool the towns look. You decide that you are going to spend all you're free time at the Hudson Highlands State Park. You spent too much time in a city and you're not gonna do the drive just to go explore another city.</p>
	<p>You start off by renting a kayak and going solo on the hudson. You admire the towering hills and mountains surrounding you. They're like skyscrapers but alive and pretty. You row and row until you're arms arms are aching and then you decide to head back to the rental guy. You decide that since you're arms are basically incapable of anything now that it would be a good time to go hiking. You take the easiest trail you can hind because this is a brand new territory for you and dont feel comfortable doing anything more difficult. You manage to get on top of ledge and it's here where you find one of the prettiest sights you've ever seen. The look from the top of the MET or from the Empire State cannot compare to this view now.</p>
	<h4>This was an awesome trip and all but this is getting pretty lonley. Where should I go now? </h4>
