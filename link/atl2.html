	<h1>Day 2 of Atlantic City!</h1>
	<p>You wake up and ask your gambling friend from the night before, Ashley, if you can shower and freshen up at her placr before you guys leave for the day. She allows you to and when you finish, you see Ashley hunched over an empty stainless steel pot dry heaving. You asks if shes okay and she raspily says to go have fun without her. You gather your stuff and head out to get a bite to eat. When you arrive at the local Dunkin Donuts you realize that your credit card is missing. You start to panic that you left it at the casnio bar last night but you remember that you had dropped it before stumbling into Ashley's apartmet and picking it up and putting it back in it's slot. You realize that this girl just stole your card and immedietly call your credit card company to cancel the card.</p>

	<h4>You look into your wallet sadly and realize you only have enough money to get back home.</h4>
