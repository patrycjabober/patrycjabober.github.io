	<h1>You've arrived at Niagra Falls!</h1>
	<p>You manage to get past border security and you are amazed the sight before your eyes even before you park. You manage to get parking and run to the waterfall.. It seemed like it was calling out your name all this time. You get to the walkway and you feel paralyzed with love. The beauty of Niagra Falls has caused you to become completly immobile. All you can do is stand in awe of this magnifcent beast. You manage to regain the abailty to walk and you walk up to the edge of the fence and you rest your headon your hand and you stare at the falls until you realize thatit pitch bacl and most of the people around you have left. </p>
