	<h1>You've arrived at Cape May!</h1>
	<p>This place is so beautiful. You've never seen houses like these. You thought that houses like these didn't exist anymore. Thye look like they are staight out of your 5th garde textbook. You continue to walk down the street amazed at the houses unitl you stumble upon a cool looking town. It's not one you'd see in an old european town, nyc, or your average suburban town. This one is quiant and has a lot of personality. You end up doing some window shopping, when you decide you wanna go down to the beach. You get down there and it's so peaceful. A complete change from Atlantic city and Wildwood. You enjoy the peace and serenity the town has offered you.  </p>

	<h4> Beautiful end to a great road trip. Do you want to go straight home?</h4>
