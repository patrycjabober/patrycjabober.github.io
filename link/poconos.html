	<h1>You've arrived in the Poconos!</h1>
	<p>It is absoluetly goregous here. This is nothing like youve ever seen efore. There are trees everywhere! It's acatually gorgeous. You spend your time going to the Deleware Water Gap because you heard it is a must if you are going to go to Pennsylvannia. When you get there immedietly you see why they say tha. You are are engolfed with mountains. You decide you are gonna hike up to see this water gap. You've seen pictures of the ones taken from the hudson in the hudson valley so you imagine this will be just like that . You are inncorrect because it is a hundred times more beutiful than that. You are lamost brought to tears at the sight of the snake like river slithering its way throught the tall green and forested mountains. Intsead of taking a picture and leaving you decide yto sit down by the egde and meditate.</p>
