	<h1>You've arrived in Ocean City, Maryland!</h1>
	<p>
		This place is like Wilwood but so much more different. It has the amusement park like Wildwood but it also seems to be much calmer here. Everyone in Wildwood seemed like they were hyped up on 10 cans of red bull and/or cocaine. Here everyone is having just as much fun but the fun seems to be more innocent and softer. It really is just what you needed, calm fun. I get myself Ocean City's famous bucket of fries and sit on a bench and people watch. You smile seeing the kids dragging their parent to go to Ripley's Believe it or not and laugh at the sight of kids stomping their feet and jumping up and down after leaving the beach. All of this makes you miss your little sister back in NYC.

	<h4>It was so great to experiecne all those boardwalks. Even though they were all similar in their content , they all had very different atmospheres. After all that fun, should I go straight home to see my little sister or should I stay just a little bit longer to reminence about my trip?  </h4>
