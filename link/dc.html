	<h1>You've arrived in Washington D.C.!</h1>
	<p>Whenyou arrive the tiredness hits you all that driving and walking and exploring has really worn you out. You manage to get to the US Capitol and just sit on the steps and gaze upon the water in front of you. The sensation gives you a weird feeling. You feel powerful and in caharge of the world but you feel calm at ease. You walk around capitol hill just gazing upon what the capital of your beautiful country looks likes. It's all gorgeous white buildings and tress and shrubery that look so perfect that they dont even seem real. You manage to get back to capital hll and just plop down onto the steps and just close your eys and take in the aor around you. </p>

	<h4>It was so great to experiecne all those cities. You love how even though all these cities are in the same country, they all have their own story to tell. Their little stories come together and create the history of the US and I think that is just amazing. After all that exploring, should I go straight home to do more refelcting?  </h4>
