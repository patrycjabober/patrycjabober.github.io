		<h1>You've arrived in Montreal!</h1>
	<p>You go immedietly to Old Montreal. There is no need to look around the city for you suspect that it'll be similar to NYC. You are not dissapointed in the Old City for you feel like you've been transported back to the 1800s. You feel so happy. You just feel incredible joy because none of the buildings around you are similar to any building you've seen int the city. These are decorated and short. They are whimsical, almost. You head to Notre Dame's Basilica and your jaw drops. This has to be the most beautiful church you have ever seen. NYC has some pretty nice churches but this is something else. All I can saw is 'wow'. </p>

	<h4>This whole trip was amazing. I've gotten to see nature and experience other cities as well but I think its time for me to go home now.  </h4>
