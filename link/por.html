	<h1>You've arrived in Portland!</h1>
	<p>You arrive in Portland and instead of going to the city senter you go to Fort William Park. You didn't come to Portand just to look at more buildings you came to lighthouses and the beautiful waters portland has to offer. You get there and you are stunned to see what they have there. They have everything you can imagine but ten times better than you thought it'd be. You get up to the light house they have there and you stay up theres as long as you can. You feel like you are on top of the world. You feel like you are the ruler of the sea looking out to see you land. You close your eyes to try to imagine a world in which that was your life. Yo </p>
	<p></p>
	<h4>The view from the lighthouse was so amazing. Its the perfect place to day dream and relfect, since you a the edge of the world well at least the edge of the US. Now that your at the edge, what do you do?  </h4>
