	<h1>You've arrived in Wildwood!</h1>
	<p>After you clean up from a eventful night. You go straight for the beachfront amusement/water park. Wildwood is known for it's rides, lets see if if it lives up to the hype. 
	You go on numerous rides from the Ferris Wheel, twisty water slides, and etc. After a while the exhustion hits you, you get off the bumper car and go straight for the funnel cakes. You decide instead of sitting down to eat. You'll take it to go and eat while you walk down the pier towards the sunset. </p>
