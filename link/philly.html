	<h1>You've arrived in Philidelphia. Home of the Philly Cheesesteak and the Liberty Bell.</h1>
	<p>During your stay you visit Independence Hall, the birthplace of the Declaration of Indepence and the US Constitution. Being in this building you get an overwhelming feeling of pride and power. You find it amazing that in 1776, your country (although small and weak compared to Britain) decided to rebel against the king because they believed in freedom and were willing to figh and die for it. It is one thing to learn about it in class and another to be in the space where the declaration to be free was writen. </p>
	<p> After your visit you stop for a bite to eat. You know you can't leave the city without getting a Cheesesteak, so that is exactly what you get. You get it to go, so you can walk through the 18th Century Garden and to see the Liberty Bell.</p>
	<h4>You decide it's time to hit the road. Where do you go now?</h4>
