	<h1>You've arrived at Lake George!</h1>
	<p>Lake George is perfect for you! It combines the aesthisism of the hudson valley but has so many people walking up and down it's little village. You decide you are going to spend you're first moments here exploring the town and it's shops. You walk down the street and you come across a big park, you go into it and notice theres a big chatter going on. You notice that there is a play going on! Specifically a Shakespearen Play. You end up laughing, crying, and clapping surprisingly enough. You end up up talking to one of the actors from the show and they told you that they're a preschool teacher during the weekdays and does these shows during the weekend. It's so refresing to meet someone who's not a pretentious actor wannab be. There was a sense of authenticity to her, something that is lacking in the people in NYC.  </p>
	<p>You end up spending the rest of the afternoon renting out another kayak. Even though your arms are still sore from yesterday, you still manage to get two hours worth of kayaking before they feel like they're gonna fall off. The view from the lake was awesome. It was similar to one from the hudson valley but you can see beaches filled with familes and friends and you can see others in kayaks too and some even on jet skis. It feel like all of here in Lake George are all one big family.</p>
	<h4>The lake was beautiful but I think I can't kayak or do any other water sport for the next 10 years. Where should I go now? </h4>
