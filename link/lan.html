	<h1>You've arrived in Amish Country aka Lancaster County!</h1>
	<p>
		You get to Lancaster county and you're very excited to see how to the Amish live. You've heard about them on TV and in school but you don't really know how they live. You get a buggy ride and you are immedietly captivated by the guides. The tour guides Aaron and Jessica were both dressed head to toe in traditional 17th century clothing. They were telling us all about their life on the farm and how they would trade their life or childhood with anybody elses. It amazes you that someone who grew up in a time that advanced technology is available to the general public could be so happy not using it or being involved in that society. 
		They bring you to a homestead where you visit a One-Room school. You remember you watched a movie once set in the 1800s that looked just like this. This whole scene uncovering before you doesnt even seem real. It seems like a movie set, but it's not. 
	<h4>After a while this place starts to creep you out. Its time to hit the road again. Where to this time?</h4>
