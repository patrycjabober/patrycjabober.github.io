	<h1>You've arrived in Providence!</h1>
	<p>You arrive in Providence and your amazed at the city here. This is suppose to be the buggest city in Rhode Isalnd and it is so small. I guess the city reflects the state. They are a close-knit new endland community looking out for their world. I really get the feeling of warmness, not because of the weather but because it is emenating from the people. You end off your trip by going down to the Rovidence Performing Arts Center to catch a show. It ends up being better then expected. It's actually pretty comparable to the ones in the city. Then again the ones you'd be comparring it to are all the student films and shows you went to see in your freshmen year. So the ones in the city were better but providence still has the nicest people. </p>

	<h4>This whole trip was amazing. I've gotten to see so much of the east coast and I am surprised how different all the places were. I didn't expect every place to be like NYC, but more like Long Island which they completely weren't so that made me really happy that I got to enjoy the east coast without getting a hint of NYC. You are now out of time to drive anywhere else besides home, do you go straight there? </h4>
