	<h1>You've arrived in Burlington!</h1>
	<p>You go up to Burlington, and the area looks so cute. You head to their infamous Farmer's Market up there, and you quickly discover that it is infamous for a reason. They have everything over there food, drinks, music, art and craft, and more. You make a point to experience all of what the market has to offer. </p>

	<h4>I love Burlington. The city is small and close together. Yet it's the size of a proper city. Where should I go now?</h4>
