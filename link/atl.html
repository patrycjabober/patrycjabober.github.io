	<h1>You've arrived in Atlantic City!</h1>
	<p>You first decide to head to the beach. It's been forever since you went to the beach. The last time you went was probably when you were 8 and went to Conney Island. You remember that there was trash everywhere and were too scared of garbage water to go into the water. 
	The sand is soft and the water feels really nicon your feet. You take your sweatshirt off and sit and enjoy the breeze and view. You realize its probably time to eat. 
	You take your shoes in hand and tie your sweatshirt around your waist and go off to find some boardwalk food. You end up finding a Nathan's and immedietly go up to get a corn dog. you remember that when you did go to Coney Island 13 years ago the best part was having a Nathan's corndog and this moment not isn't any different. It tastes as good as you remember. 
	You go up and down the boardwalk until you see the sunset. The view almost makes you forget you were going to go gambling. You withdraw $300 bucks and put on the little black dress you packed and go out to blow your last paycheck. You end up going to the nearest casino and try out all the card games and roulette games and you actually end up gaining like $100 bucks by the end of the night. After all the games and casual drinks you had you make a gambling friend, who invites you to a party, where you end up spending the rest of your night dancing and drinking the night away. You wake up in the morning feeling woozy but energized. You feel like the world is in your fingertips and you can do anything. </p>
	<h4>Do you think you should stay and relish the feeling of uphoria with your new friend or do you think you should take advantage of this feeling and explore as many more cities as you can?</h4>
