	<h1>You've arrived at Alexandria Bay, home of the Thousand Islands!</h1>
	<p>You've had enough of kayaking it is good to be somewhere I do not have to do any of that. You buy a ticket for a boat tour of the Thousand Islands. You get on and are amazed at how many islands there are surrounding you. There's so many but it hardly seems enough to be a thousand. The question of whether or not there are a thousand islands on this bay area begins to haunt you. It haunts you so much that you end up interupting the tour guide to ask your questions. She ends up playing a guessing game with the guests and she reveles that there are in fact over 1,700 islands. You are shocked but at ease. The answers allows you enjoy the tour more and it gives you an impression of how small you are in comparssion to the bay and islands.  </p>
	<p>The boat drops you off at a couple Island where you can explore these massive castle like structures. You feel like a princess walking through your domain where you go go within these buildings. They transport you to another world where you love in a beautifully decorated room and have you're on wait staff and not one where you live in a tiny cramed apartment. </p>
	<h4>Those islands were so cool. What now? </h4>
