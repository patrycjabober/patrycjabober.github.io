	<h1>You've arrived in Newport!</h1>
	<p>Cliff Walk! Cliff Walk! Newports Cliff Walk is so beautful. There is nothing but beautiful mansions and the altnctic sea.You sit by one of the benches the mansion has and you take in the world around you. Suddendly you get a unsettling feeling. The people around you are starting to remind you of the ones in NYC and the Mansions suddendly turn from goregous to being too much. </p>
	<p></p>
	<h4>The mansions were gorgeous but their pretensious nature is reminding me more and more of New York. Where should I escape to? </h4>
