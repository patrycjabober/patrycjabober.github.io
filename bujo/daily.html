    <p>
      Just under a year ago, I shared my daily planning routine over on YouTube. Although my process has remained very much the same, I still get a lot of questions about my routine, so I’m sharing an update with you here today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I jump into explaining my routine, I want to address something that I’ve seen come up time and time again — the concept that Bullet Journaling is time-consuming and that you spend more time planning than actually doing the things.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my case, that’s simply not true.   
    </p>
      <p>
     Maintaining a Bullet Journal and making it work for you can seem like a daunting task, but I’m here to assure you that it doesn’t have to be. Even with my doodles and “artsy” entries, I only spend an average of around 30 minutes to an hour each day in my Bullet Journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure, there are lazy Sunday afternoons where I might dive in and spend a couple of relaxing hours being creative and artistic, but the vast majority of the time that I spend in my Bullet Journal is planning, assessing my progress, and evaluating/improving my system.   
    </p>
     <p>
      It is my firm belief that having a daily planning routine in place has been the single largest factor in my success over the past year and a half. Today, I’m going to share that exact routine with you :)
    </p>
    <h4>
      MY DAILY PLANNING ROUTINE
    </h4>
     <p>
      I do the majority of my daily planning in the evening right before bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like planning at this time because it allows me to reflect on how my day went and get ready for the day ahead. Every night, I sit down with my Bullet Journal about 30 minutes before I go to sleep.   
    </p>
      <p>
      In addition to feeling more “on top of” everything going on in my life and business, this screen-free downtime helps me to rest my eyes after a day of staring at my computer and phone. All electronics get shut down, and it’s just me and my Bullet Journal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here are the steps that I follow: 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>REVIEW OF CURRENT DAY</h3>
        <p>The very first thing I do when I sit down for my daily planning routine is to review my current day.  Often times I’ll mark tasks off throughout the day as I complete them, or jot down notes that I can refer back to later.</p>
        <p>I like to double check my list at this point and mark off any additional tasks that I completed and take a mental note of the tasks that I still have open.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>SET UP FOR TOMORROW</h3>
        <p>The very first thing I do to set up for the following day is to draw out my header. I like to track things like the moon phases and weather, but this, of course, is completely optional.</p>
        <p>Once my header is done, I move on to drawing out my time bar. This time bar has gone through many iterations in my Bullet Journal, but I’m currently enjoying this vertical layout.</p>
        <p>Later, I’ll segment this time bar based on my planned schedule for the day but for now, I just segment my sleeping hours. I wake up at 5:30 AM and go to sleep at 10:30 PM.</p>
        <p>Once that is finished, I check for appointments and events coming up by flipping back to my Calendex.</p>
        <p>In this particular example, I don’t have any appointments or events tomorrow. So now it’s time to move on to creating my task list and planning out my time for the day.</p>
        <p>I create my task list by first racking my brain for any tasks that I know need to get completed the following day. In the event that I’m starting a new spread, I always refer back to my previous spread and migrate over any uncompleted tasks that still need my attention.</p>
        <p>Once all of my tasks and appointments are in place, it’s time to add some color. I have a specific color code that I use throughout my Bullet Journal that allows me to see things more easily at a glance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Update Monthly Spreads</h3>
        <p>Once the following day is complete, it’s time to update my monthly spreads. I keep all of my monthly spreads together at the beginning of each month so that it is easy for me to just flip from page to page as I update them.</p>
        <p>First up is my time log.</p>
        <p>(PS – I have to admit here that I haven’t been updating my monthly spreads in the past few days because I’ve been sick and haven’t kept very good track of things… hey, life happens!)</p>
        <p>I use an app called ATracker throughout the day to keep track of where I spend my time. At the end of each day, I can see a consolidated report and log my hours here in my Bullet Journal.</p>
        <p>My monthly tracker is up next. The colors here don’t actually mean anything, but they provide a nice separation so that I can easily see where I’m doing well and where I’m falling behind for the month.</p>
        <p>My gratitude log comes next. This is where I get to be a bit creative and have some fun :)</p>
        <p>Last but certainly not least is my Mood Mandala. Inspired by Fiona (@bujo.mama on Instagram), this is where I track my general overall mood for the day.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>And that’s it!</p>
    <p>While breaking this down bit by bit may make it seem like a lengthy ordeal to some, this whole process only takes me about 30 minutes each evening.</p>
    <h4>ADVANTAGES OF PLANNING THE NIGHT BEFORE</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>You can clear your mind of all of those nagging thoughts and looming tasks so that you can get to sleep more easily.</li>
      <li>You can eliminate the morning frenzy of not knowing exactly what needs to be done when you wake up.</li>
      <li>You can hit the ground running on important tasks in the morning because you already have a clear plan for your day.</li>
    </ol>
